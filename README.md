# Windows XP Simulator
A really crappy Windows XP simulator written in C# Windows Presentation Forms with Visual Studio 2019

If you want mspaint to work you need to put this file in the root of your C drive
https://github.com/WoodcraftWorld/Downloads/blob/master/Video%20Downloads/mspaintold.exe
You also can't rename the file
